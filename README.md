## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The overarching goal of this laboratory is to delve into the realm of Shared Memory and OpenMP, shedding light on key concepts and techniques. The focus lies on harnessing compiler directives to engender concurrency, enabling the efficient utilization of modern multi-core architectures. Through the adept utilization of #pragmas (directives) and their associated clauses, this endeavor aims to unlock the potential of parallelism within threads. By unraveling the intricacies of thread-level parallelism, this laboratory strives to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to leverage these tools effectively, paving the way for optimized and responsive computational workflows.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.
